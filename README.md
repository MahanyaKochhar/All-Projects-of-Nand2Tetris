# Projects of Nand2Tetris
 This repository contains all the source code of the projects of Nand2Tetris course that I have completed so far.The goal is to build a modern computer system from the ground up.
 
 * Project 1: Boolean Logic(HDL of 15 Elementary Logic Gates)
 * Project 2: Boolean Arithmetic(HDL of ALU)
 * Project 3: Sequential Logic(HDL of RAM units)
 * Project 4: Machine Language(Low Level Symbolic Assembly Language)
 * Project 5: Computer Architecture
 * Project 6: Assembler(Assembler Program in C++)
 * Project 7: VM I: Stack Arithmetic(VM Code in C++)
 * Project 8: VM II: Program Control(VM Code in C++)
 * Project 9: High-Level Language
 * Project 10: Compiler I: Syntax Analysis
 * Project 11: Compiler II: Code Generation
 * Project 12: Operating System
